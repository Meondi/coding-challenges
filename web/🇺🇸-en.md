# Web-App Coding Challenge üë®üèº‚Äçüíª

## Task

- Create a single-page application
- Create a backend service
- Consume a 3rd party API in the backend and use the data in the frontend

The application should show **all** houses from Game of Thrones in an overview to a user.

By clicking on a house, it should be visible on a detail page with further information.

### APIs and Docs

Available tools:

- [Game Of Thrones API](https://anapioficeandfire.com)

### Requirements

- Create a SPA with a framework of your choice (Angular, React, Vue, ...)
- Create a backend service (serverless, server, ...) based on a REST or GraphQL communication, e.g. with NestJS or another framework
- Use the Game Of Thrones API in the backend and use your backend in the frontend
- Use a version control system (GitHub, Bitbucket, ...) through which you provide us with the project
- Structure your project in a mono repo approach and provide a `readme file` in the 'root folder' how we can run the project locally

### Notes

- Remember that the task is a demonstration of your skills. So please set a focus depending on where your passion is.
- If you are not able to connect the frontend to the backend application, use the Game Of Thrones API directly in the frontend.
